# ArbitrageBase
## Introduction
A basic application to perform cryptocurrency arbitrage in Python

The purpose of this repository is to share my experience in [arbitrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage) in the cryptocurrency world.

Arbitrage could seem easy at first but is actually tough. One of the main reason for that is that the barriers to entry is quite low, and hence the competition is rude.

Hopefully there are still rooms to take, thanks to the huge amount of different coins, tokens and markets.

So I hope that this repository will help you in your quest for money :-) and will teach you at least some tips and tricks.

## General Architecture

The project is composed by the following element:
* The arbitrage algorithm
* The communication with the different exchanges
* The reporting to a googlesheet and by email

## Thank you very much
